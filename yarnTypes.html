                <p><b>Yarn Weight</b></p> 
                <p>Yarn can be categorized in 8 weights: Superfine, Fine, Light, Medium, Bulky, Super Bulky, and Jumbo. Yarn weight is used to describe the thickness of the yarn. Based on the goal of your project, you should pick the appropriate sized weight yarn. If your goal is to make socks, you'd want to try a thinner weight such as Fine as opposed to Jumbo.</p>
